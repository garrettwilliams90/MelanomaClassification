# Identifying Melanoma in Images using Deep Learning
I'm identifying melanoma in images of skin lesions using neural networks, more specifically deep learning tools. The dataset was generated by the [International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)](https://challenge2020.isic-archive.com/) and includes over 38,000 images. My final model was a pretrained VGG16 neural network with an accuracy of 94% and a recall of 84%.

## Business Understanding

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. According to the World Cancer Research Fund, Australia has the highest rate of Melanoma per capita. Cancer Australia estimates close to 17,000 new cases of Melanoma have been diagnosed in 2021, resulting in over 1,000 deaths this year.

Unlike other cancers though, skin cancer can be visibly seen. By using image classification tools, my work aims to accurately predict if a skin lesion is malignant or benign. By identifying if the skin has Melanoma early on, lives can be saved. My hope is that you, the Australian Department of Health, would use your resources in conjuction with my model to develop and market an app for the benefit of your citizens. Using their mobile phone, they can easily take a picture and recognize whether they need to go to a dermatologist for further diagnosis.

## Data Understanding

The data was created by the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) and International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). SIIM is the leading healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging who's mission is to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research, and innovation in a multi-disciplinary community. ISIC is an international effort to improve melanoma diagnosis. The ISIC Archive contains the largest publicly available collection of quality-controlled dermoscopic images of skin lesion. I was able to use the data through the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification competition on Kaggle.

One limitation of the dataset is the size of images. Since the images had different sizes and were too large for my code to run, I used resized images, found here. Another major limitation from this dataset is how imbalanced the target is. 98% of the over 33,000 images were classified as benign. To combat this imbalance, I added malignant images from the 2019 SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification competition, found here. I also added malignant images that weren't used in the 2019 or 2020 competitions, found here.
